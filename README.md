Network Open Ports Scanning Task
Task Objective
The purpose of this task was to scan my local network to discover open ports on connected devices. Open ports identify network services running on devices, which can reveal potential security exposures. This task helped me learn basic network reconnaissance skills and understand network security concepts.

Steps Performed
Installed Nmap: Downloaded and installed the free Nmap tool, which performs network port scanning.

Determined Local IP Range: Found my networkâ€™s IP address range (e.g., 192.168.29.0/24) using system commands.

Performed Network Scan: Ran a TCP SYN scan (nmap -sS) across the local subnet to detect devices and open ports.

Captured Network Traffic: Optionally used Wireshark to capture and analyze packets generated by the Nmap scan.

Researched Services: Matched detected open ports to common services (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, MySQL, etc.) and looked up unknown ports.

Identified Security Risks: Reviewed the open ports and services for potential vulnerabilities or unnecessary exposure.

Saved Scan Results: Exported scan results to files for documentation and further analysis.

Key Findings
Several devices in the local subnet responded to the scan.

Common services like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and MySQL (3306) were running on multiple devices.

Some potentially risky ports were identified, such as UPnP (1900) and Microsoft SMB ports (139, 445).

Recommendations were made to secure, update, or disable unnecessary services and close exposed ports where possible.

Notes and Conclusion
This task was valuable to understand how network scanning works and the risks associated with open ports. Using tools like Nmap and Wireshark together provides both a high-level and packet-level view of network exposure. Regular scanning and monitoring are crucial to maintaining network security by identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities early.
